Install
==========

The rapidest way to install treelib is using the package management tools like
``easy_install`` or ``pip`` with command

	.. code-block:: sh

		$ sudo easy_install -U treelib

or the setup script

	.. code-block:: sh

		$ sudo python setup.py install

**Note**: With the package management tools, the hosted version may be falling
behind current development branch on `Github
<https://github.com/caesar0301/pyTree>`_. If you encounter some problems, try
the freshest version on Github or open `issues
<https://github.com/caesar0301/pyTree/issues>`_ to let me know your problem.
